# ContextFlow: In-Context Flow Matching for Robot Manipulation

Full pretrained π0 + ContextFlow control (also includes π0.5): [setup and validation](docs/FULL_CONTEXTFLOW.md).


This repository contains the model and training/evaluation code for **ContextFlow** — a model that conditions on **in-context demonstrations** (demo images, states, and actions of a related task) to generalize to unseen tasks without fine-tuning.

It is a fork of [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) by the [Physical Intelligence team](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/) and builds on their base model, the [π₀ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0), a flow-based diffusion VLA.

It is trained and evaluated on the [LIBERO benchmark](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) with a seen/unseen task split.

## Requirements

To run the models in this repository, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with at least the following specifications. These estimations assume a single GPU, but you can also use multiple GPUs with model parallelism to reduce per-GPU memory requirements by configuring `fsdp_devices` in the training config. The current training script does not support multi-node training.

| Mode                    | Memory Required | Example GPU        |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Inference               | > 16 GB         | A100 (80GB)        |
| Fine-Tuning (LoRA)       | > 40 GB         | A100 (80GB)        |

The default ContextFlow training configuration uses `batch_size=32`. The repo has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Installation

Clone the repo with submodules (the LIBERO simulator is a submodule; LeRobot itself is pulled by `uv sync`):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dingjiansw101/ContextFlow.git
cd ContextFlow

# Or if you already cloned the repo:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies. Once uv is installed, run:

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
```

NOTE: `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` is needed to pull LeRobot as a dependency.

## Model Checkpoints

### Base model (initialization for training)

Training the in-context models starts from the pre-trained π₀ base checkpoint, which is downloaded automatically from Physical Intelligence's S3 bucket on first use (cached in `~/.cache/openpi`; override with `OPENPI_DATA_HOME`):

| Model   | Checkpoint Path                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| π₀ base | `s3://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_base` |

### In-context model checkpoints (Google Drive)

The Google Drive folder [`ContextFlow_Data`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bf5j90lifJ9kPy2YSQG1bp5FKWZwzTES) provides the ContextFlow configuration and trained weights. Download the complete checkpoint directory for inference.

| Model | Config name | Checkpoint path inside `ContextFlow_Data` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ContextFlow | `ContextFlow` | `ContextFlow/ContextFlow_run1/19999` |

Download via the browser link above, or with [rclone](https://rclone.org/drive/) (using your own configured Google Drive remote, here called `gdrive:`):

```bash
FOLDER=1Bf5j90lifJ9kPy2YSQG1bp5FKWZwzTES
# Checkpoint → local layout expected by the eval commands (checkpoints/<config>/<exp>/<step>)
rclone copy --drive-root-folder-id $FOLDER gdrive:ContextFlow/ContextFlow_run1/19999 \
    checkpoints/ContextFlow/ContextFlow_run1/19999
```

## Running Experiments on LIBERO

Follow the [LIBERO guide](examples/libero/LIBERO_README.md) to set up the simulator, train ContextFlow, and evaluate a downloaded or newly trained checkpoint. It includes commands for unseen-task evaluation and repeated runs.

`examples/libero/main_incontext.py` evaluates unseen tasks by default and reports their success rate.

### Interactive launcher

After installing the policy environment in `.venv`, the simulator environment in
`examples/libero/.venv`, and downloading the dataset and checkpoints, run:

```bash
bash quickstart.sh
```

Choose **6 → 5 → 50** to start a policy server and evaluate the two unseen tasks
in each of LIBERO-Spatial and LIBERO-Object, with 50 trials per task. The launcher
starts a fresh server for each suite and stops it when evaluation finishes.
`bash quickstart.sh --dry-run` previews commands without starting the workloads.

`source scripts/activate_env.sh train` or `source scripts/activate_env.sh libero`
activates the corresponding environment. By default, datasets are stored in
`../datasets` and the OpenPI cache in `../models/openpi`, relative to the repository;
override these with `LEROBOT_HOME` and `OPENPI_DATA_HOME`. The checkpoint prompt
defaults to `checkpoints/ContextFlow/ContextFlow_run1/19999`.

Logs and results are saved under descriptive, timestamped `logs/quickstart/`
directories. Videos are grouped by task instruction and exported at 20 FPS.

Choose **9** for the milk / tomato-sauce context experiment. Both are held-out
LIBERO-Object tasks. The launcher runs each language instruction with its own
demonstration (`correct`), all demonstration masks disabled (`no`), and the other
task's demonstration (`wrong`). Language and live observations remain unchanged.
Each condition uses the same initial states and per-replan random seeds. It runs
a fixed 280 control steps, checking both objects' LIBERO `In` predicates each step;
neither goal ends a trial early. Results distinguish `language_only`, `other_only`,
`both`, and `neither`, with paired transition counts in `comparison.json`.
This is a separate intervention protocol, not the original Table 1 evaluation.
The two task scenes differ, so comparisons are paired within each language/task.

Videos are stored under `<run>/<condition>/videos/<instruction>/`, with actions,
end-effector/gripper trajectories, object positions, and per-step goal predicates
in `<condition>/trajectories/`. Each episode also records its actual demonstration
and random seeds. This launcher uses local-only demonstration loading.

The policy server and simulator can run on separate machines; set `--host` on the evaluation client to the server address. To test the server with random observations, see the [simple client](examples/simple_client/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                     | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uv sync` fails with dependency conflicts | Try removing the virtual environment directory (`rm -rf .venv`) and running `uv sync` again. Check that you have the latest version of `uv` installed (`uv self update`). |
| In-context inference results are unstable / degraded | Export `JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=float32` and pass `--policy.inference_dtype=float32` to `serve_policy.py`. |
| Training runs out of GPU memory           | Set `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9` before training so JAX can use 90% of GPU memory. You can also reduce the batch size, or shard with `fsdp_devices` in the training config. |
| Simulator renders black images / EGL errors during LIBERO eval | Export `MUJOCO_GL=egl` and make sure an NVIDIA EGL vendor library is installed. |
| Dataset download fails                    | Check your internet connection. If using `local_files_only=True`, verify the dataset exists locally. For HuggingFace datasets, ensure you're logged in (`huggingface-cli login`). |
| Policy server connection errors           | Check that the server is running and listening on the expected port. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings between client and server. |
